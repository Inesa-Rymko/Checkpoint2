As usual, I study deeply English and maths. My mathematics teacher moved to Germany  a year. That is  I have another teacher at  всего хорошего,друг .  I like  as well.
I am doing well at English. I have been watching films in English every    months already. At  moment I am watching films with subtitles,  hopefully, soon I will be able to understand everything without them.
I think, this is a very good  to enlarge one�s vocabulary.

Cinema plays an important role in  life of any society. It is an'available popular form of art. Lots of people find going to  cinema one of  best ways of spending their leisure time.  movie audience is predominantly a young one.
 to numerous video facilities, cinema attendances have declined sharply.  there is no denying  fact that  cinema-going habit is still a strong one.
No matter  large  place  live in is (whether it's a  city or a small provincial town, or even a settlement) there's most likely to be a cinema there.
There are such genres of feature films as  western,  thriller,  musical,  drama and  comedy.  performance lasts from  or three hours and most cinemas have at least 4 performances a . There is no doubt that a good cinema show is an excellent entertainment and quite cheap.
Of late cinema screens in this country have been dominated by films produced in  USA. And this tendency is growing.
As  me, I'm fond of going to  cinema. It's a pity, I don't always have time  it. It's an open secret that we live in a very difficult time .  people do need something amusing and pleasant, something to laugh at. That's  I give my preference to comedies. 
 last comedy, I , is "Crocodile Dandy".  film tells about amusing adventures of a young lovely woman - reporter and a strong and brave crocodile hunter. At first, their relations were  friendly.  even looked down on  and he in return neglected . 
 after he rescued  out of some difficult situations, their relations became more friendly. A happy end is an essential feature of American films.  same is true of this comedy.  main characters fall in love with each other in  end of  film.
