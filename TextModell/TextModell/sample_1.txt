As usual, I study deeply English and maths. My mathematics teacher moved to Germany for a year. That is why I have another teacher at the moment. But I like him as well.
I am doing well at English. I have been watching films in English every day for two months already. At the moment I am watching films with subtitles, but hopefully, soon I will be able to understand everything without them. I think, this is a very good way to enlarge one’s vocabulary.
I have recently been playing volleyball in the park? You know, I like this kind of sports. I have met a really nice girl there. Her name is Lena. Next time I am going to invite her to the cinema. It looks like I go to the park to see her rather than play volleyball )))
My brother has started to work in an interior design studio? He enjoys it a lot more than his previous job. My parents are planning to buy a new flat. This one is too small now.
Valera, Andrey and I often think about you. It is a pity that you had to go. It was so much fun when you were here. It is Andrey’s birthday soon. It is sad that we will have to celebrate it without you. I hope you will be able to come and visit us when it is my birthday.
